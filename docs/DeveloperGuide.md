## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="400" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<br>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Database`**](#database-component) parses data from within the App on startup. This data is used to support user input validation according to the business logic.<br>
[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<br>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete CS2030S`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="585" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above), as well as the [**`Database`**](#database-component) component,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModulePlanPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `ModulePlanSemester` object residing in the `Model`.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

<br>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete CS2030S")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram2.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to a `ModulePlanParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<br>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

<br>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModulePlanParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ModulePlanParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

<br>

The `Model` component,

* stores the module plan data i.e., all `Module` objects (which are contained in `UniqueModuleList` objects).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* stores a `ModuleData` object that represents the information on all modules. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyModuleData` object.
* does not depend on any of the other four components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The module plan data is split into different semesters (e.g. Year 1 S1, Year 1 S2, Year 2 S1, etc). Instead of one `UniqueModuleList` storing all of the user's modules across multiple semesters, each semester's modules are stored in their own `UniqueModuleList` object. Nevertheless, modules are required to be unique across semesters, meaning that the same module will be prevented from being added to multiple semesters. The implementation of this check can be found in `ModulePlanSemesterList`.

</box>

<br>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

<br>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve modifiable objects that belong to the `Model`)

<br>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Database component

**API** : [`Database.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/database/Database.java)

<puml src="diagrams/DatabaseClassDiagram.puml" width="230" />

<br>

The `Database` component,
* reads the module information from JSON format to the corresponding `ModuleData` object.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Database` component's job is to retrieve read-only objects that belong to the `Model`)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The module data is stored within the resource folder. In the case where the data cannot be read successfully, a `RuntimeException` is deliberately triggered to forcefully halt the application's execution. This is necessary because all features are reliant on the module data.

</box>

<br>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the [`seedu.address.commons`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons) package.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Module Plan

#### Overview

ModulePlan is a collection of classes that wraps all the information regarding the user's timetable and houses all the `Module` in the user's study plan. It has a facade class `ModulePlan` that handles all calls into the ModulePlan Component. The internal lists can only be modified through calls to the facade class as it is only exposed as a `unmodifiableObservableList`.

The ModulePlan implementation consists of 4 levels of classes in the following order:
* `ModulePlan`
* `ModulePlanSemesterList`
* `ModulePlanSemester`
* `UniqueModuleList`

The class diagram below shows the OOP structure of the ModulePlan component:

<puml src="diagrams/ModulePlanClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

#### Implementation

**ModulePlan**: <br>

`ModulePlan` is the facade class of the ModulePlan component. It contains exactly 1 `ModulePlanSemesterList` that is initialised whenever a new instance of `ModulePlan` is created. There isn't any logic implemented in this class, it just passes down information to the lower level classes and relays back the response to the caller.

**ModulePlanSemesterList**: <br>

`ModulePlanSemesterList` is where the main logic regarding modules that belong in different semesters is implemented. `ModulePlanSemesterList` contains a `internalList` of `ModulePlanSemester` and when a instance of `ModulePlanSemesterList` is created, its constructor populates the `internalList` with copies of a list of default `ModulePlanSemester` called `DEFAULT_SEMESTER`. `DEFAULT_SEMESTER` is a class level immutable list of `ModulePlanSemester` of both Semester 1 and 2 from Year 1 to 4. <br>

* `ModulePlanSemesterList` implements the check for duplicate modules with the function `containsModule`. 
* The function `findSemester` is used to figure out which `ModulePlanSemester` to pass the module to while also acting as a check for whether the module in question is in the ModulePlan.
* `getCAP` and `modularCredit` is also where the CAP and MC respectively are collated across all the semesters.
* `ModulePlanSemesterList` also contains the logic for adding `ModulePlanSemester` outside of the default ones and removing them when they are empty. These are implemented in the `addModule` and `removeModule` functions respectively with the assistance of some helper functions like `checkIfSemesterEmpty` and `inDefaultSemesters`.

**ModulePlanSemester**: <br>

`ModulePlanSemester` is modeled after a semester in the timetable. It is identified by the fields `Year` and `Semester` and contains 1 `UniqueModuleList`. Like `ModulePlan`, there is not much logic implemented here and it mainly passes the input down and relays the result back up the hierarchy.<br>

However, the logic for checking and grouping all Year 0 modules is implemented here, in the `checkModuleBelongToSemester` and `checkIfSameSemester` functions. 

**UniqueModuleList**: <br>

`UniqueModuleList` is where the `Module` objects are housed, in the `ObservableList` called `internalList`. It is also where logic for modules in the same semester are implemented. <br>

* The functions `contains` and `modulesAreUnique` ensures that there is no duplicates within this semester.
* The functions `modularCredits`, `findGradePointsWithUnits` and `findMcsForCap` calculates the CAP/MC for this particular semester only.
<br><br><br>

The following diagrams shows the flow for the **main uses** of ModulePlan, adding and removing modules.

<box type="info" seamless><md>
**Note:** The implementation of editing a module is removing the original and then adding the edited module.
</md></box>

**Add Module**: <br>

<puml src="diagrams/ModulePlanAddSequenceDiagram.puml" />

**Delete Module**: <br>

<puml src="diagrams/ModulePlanDeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" />

#### UI Integration

Changes in the ModulePlan are displayed to the user through an observer pattern where the `listview` in the UI class `ModulePlanPane` listens to the `ObservableList` in `ModulePlanSemesterList` and the `listview` in `ModulePlanCard` listens to the the `ObservableList` in `UniqueModuleList`.
The individual modules are then displayed in `ModuleCard`. <br>

However, as changes in the `UniqueModuleList` will not propagate to the `ObservableList` in `ModulePlanSemesterList`, there is a need for the function `refreshList` to update the `ObservableList` in `ModulePlanSemesterList` whenever changes in the `UniqueModuleList` occurs.<br>

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Data Structure to Store `Module`**

* **Alternative 1 (Chosen)**: Store it in OOP fashion.
  * Pros: Closely models the real world way of organizing the study plan (into each semester), logic for organizing and sorting the modules can be contained in the model instead of the Ui.
  * Cons: A lot of overhead with the 4 level of classes.
* **Alternative 2**: Store it in a single list.
  * Pros: Simple to implement and very little overhead.
  * Cons: Ui component needs to organise the Module when displaying to user which is not what the Ui component is meant to do. Harder to visualise the data and thus harder to test and maintain code.  

Alternative 1 is ultimately chosen as it helps abstracts out the logic for different semester to the Model component where it is meant to be and having a OOP structure makes it easier to visualise and thus test/maintain code. Which is important as this is a team-based project.

<br>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Module Storage

#### Overview

Modcraft stores two types of information on the hard drive, ModulePlan and UserPrefs(User Preferences).
ModulePlan stores the user's last saved module plan when using Modcraft allowing the user to access their module plan
across sessions. UserPrefs contains the last known user interface settings when using Modcraft allowing the user to
return to their preferred interface across sessions.

ModulePlan is stored as `moduleplan.json` and UserPrefs is stored as `preferences.json`. Both files will be created if
they do not already exist in the same folder in which the Modcraft jar file is stored. While users are free to access
and modify the files as they wish it is recommended that they make a backup before any modifications. If Modcraft
cannot access a file, it will be deleted and replaced with a new empty file.

#### Feature details

1. When the user launches the application, if there is no `moduleplan.json` or `preferences.json` file detected in the
same folder as Modcraft or they are corrupted, Modcraft will create them and populate them with the default moduleplan
and preferences respectively.
2. If there are existing `moduleplan.json` and `preferences.json` files with appropriate data, Modcraft will read the
module plan from `moduleplan.json` and user preferences from `preferences.json`, loading the application with the
information obtained from the files.
3. Upon execution of any command that alters the user's module plan, the changes will automatically be saved into
`moduleplan.json`.
4. Upon alteration of any part of the user interface, the changes will automatically be saved into `preferences.json`.


#### Initialization sequence

1. At startup, `MainApp` calls `MainApp#initPrefs` to attempt to parse the `preferences.json` file.
2. `MainApp#initPrefs` calls `Storage#readUserPrefs` to obtain the user preferences as a `UserPrefs` object.
   2a. If `DataLoadingException` is thrown, a new `preferences.json` file will be created with default preferences.
3. `JsonUserPrefsStorage` deserializes the JSON file by calling `JsonUtil#readJsonFile` into a `UserPrefs` object.
3. `MainApp` creates a `StorageManager` object with the file paths of `preferences.json` and `moduleplan.json`.
4. `MainApp#initModelManager` is then called which calls `Storage#readModulePlan` attempting to parse the
`moduleplan.json` file and create a `modulePlan` object.
   4a. If `DataLoadingException` is thrown, a new `moduleplan.json` file will be created with the default module plan.
5. `JsonModulePlanStorage` deserializes the JSON file into a `JsonSerializableModulePlan` object by calling
`JsonUtil#readJsonFile`.
   5a. The `JsonSerializableModulePlan` object represents a list of `JsonAdaptedModule` objects, created during
deserialization.
6. `JsonModulePlanStorage` then calls `JsonSerizaliableModulePlan#toModelType` to create the `ReadOnlyModulePlan` object.
   6a. `JsonAdaptedModule` then calls `JsonAdapedModule#toModelType` for the creation of each `module`.
7. `ModulePlan` is returned to `MainApp` where it is used to initialize `ModelManager`, which is used during command
execution.
8. A `DataLoadingException` is thrown when any of the following occus.
   - the file cannot be found.
   - an error occurs during deserialization, or
   - the data contains invalid values.


This can be seen in the sequence diagram below

<puml src="diagrams/StorageInitSequenceDiagram.puml" />

<br>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Module Data

#### Overview

The `ModuleData` object represents an internal list of all possible modules, which forms the base of the application. It allows for validation of the module codes in user input, and provides the required identity fields for the creation of modules to be saved to the user's study plan.

#### Implementation

Though the internal list utlizes the same class as `ModulePlan`, here the `UniqueModulesList modules` field models the full list of all NUS modules instead of the list of a user's modules in a given semester. It maintains the same property of protecting against duplicate modules, which are identified based on their similar module codes. 

The `checkDbValidModuleCode(ModuleCode)` method fufills one of the two motivations of `ModuleData`: validation. It simply iterates through the internal list and checks if a module with a matching module code exists. It allows Modcraft to distinguish between valid and invalid modules codes during command execution.

Another purpose of `ModuleData` is to provide information about a module (e.g. its name, description and number of modular credits), if it is a valid NUS module. This is fufilled by the `getModule(ModuleCode)` method, which returns the desired module as an immutable `Module` object. This immutability is vital to preserve the correctness of the module information, so that future references to `ModuleData` return the same results.

#### Initialization

The module information (of over 15000 modules!) is stored as `moduleinfo.json` in the `src/main/resources/database` folder. Upon launching ModCraft, the module information is deserialized (with the help of the Jackson library) from JSON format to the `ModuleData` object through a series of conversions. The `Module` fields are parsed into Strings and combined into a `JsonAdaptedDbModule` object, which is then further collated into a `JsonSerializableModuleData` object. When the `JsonSerializableModuleData#toModelType` method is called, an empty `ModuleData` object is created before the conversion of all `JsonAdaptedDbModule` objects into `Module` objects, which are then added into `ModuleData`.

This initialization process can be shown through following sequence diagrams:

<puml src="diagrams/JsonModuleDataSequenceDiagram.puml" />

<puml src="diagrams/ToModelTypeSequenceDiagram.puml" />

<br>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Initialization failure

A `DataLoadingException` is thrown if:
* the file cannot be found,
* an error occurs during deserialization, or
* the data contains invalid values (e.g. negative modular credits)

In such cases where the data cannot be read successfully, a `RuntimeException` is deliberately triggered to forcefully abort the application's launch. This is necessary as most features are reliant on the validation and information provided by the `ModuleData` object.

</box>

#### Design considerations 

**Aspect: Location of `moduleinfo.json`**

* **Alternative 1**: Expose the file. (Similar to the ModulePlan storage file implementation)
   * Pros: The module information within the file could be inaccurate. Users will be able to easily modify/update information directly without developer intervention.
   * Cons: New users might mistakenly make unintended modifications, causing the completeness/correctness of the information to be compromised. Due to the lack of a failsafe overwrite mechanism, the application might invariably fail at startup.
* **Alternative 2 (Chosen)**: Hide the file in the resources folder.
   * Pros: Maintain the completeness and correctness of the information.
   * Cons: Lack of user customization for more advanced users. As module information changes over time, responsibilty falls on the developers to ensure the information is updated and error-free.

<br>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Add Module Command

#### Overview
The `add` command is used to add a module to the module plan with the information fields `Module Code`, `Year Taken`,
    `Semester Taken`, and `Grade`.

The format for the `add` command can be found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-0.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#adding-a-module-add)

#### Feature details
1. The user executes the `add` command.
2. If any of the fields are not provided, an error message with the appropriate command usage will be displayed.
3. If any of the command parameters are invalid, an error message with the appropriate parameter format will be displayed.
4. The `Module` is then searched in the `model` to see if it is an existing module that NUS offers. If the module is not
offered, an error message will be displayed.
5. The `Module` is then checked with `ModulePlan` to see if it has already been added to the module plan previously.
If the module has already been added the User's module plan, an error message will be displayed.
6. If all the previous stages complete without exceptions or errors, the `Module` will be added to the `ModulePlan`

The activity diagram for adding a `Module` into the module plan

<puml src="diagrams/AddModuleActivityDiagram.puml" width="475" />

The sequence of the `add` command is as follows:

1. The user inputs the `add` command.<br>
   e.g. `add CS2040S y/1 s/1 g/A`
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `ModulePlanParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `ModulePlanParser` then creates a new `AddCommandParser` to parse the fields provided by the user and 
a new `AddCommand` is created.
4. The `AddCommand` checks if the `ModuleCode` is valid bt calling `Model#getModuleFromDb` and retrieves 
the module if it exists from the database.
5. `AddCommand` then fills the user inputs into the module using the `Module#fillUserInputs` function.
6. `AddCommand` then attempts to add the module into the Model via `Model#addModule`.
7. If `ModuleCode`, the user inputs are valid, and the Model does not contain the module, `AddCommand` will 
successfully add the new `Module` into the module plan.
   
The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/AddOverallSequenceDiagram.puml" />

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Edit Module Command

#### Overview

The `edit` command is used to change the information fields (e.g. year, semester and grade) for modules in the study plan.

The format for the `edit` command can be found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-0.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#editing-a-module-edit).

#### Feature details

The edit mechanism uses `EditModuleDescriptor` to abstract out the fields to edit. It can be found as a publicly accessible class within `EditCommand`. Currently, it only contains fields for `Year`, `Semester` and `Grade`, which are the only attributes of `Module` that can be edited for now. Besides this, it largely follows the parser and command structure as described in [Logic](#logic-component).

We shall now illustrate how `EditModuleDescriptor` is used.

Here is a *Sequence Diagram* showing the parser in action:

<puml src="diagrams/EditParseSequenceDiagram.puml" />

And here is a *Sequence Diagram* showing the command being executed:

<puml src="diagrams/EditExecuteSequenceDiagram.puml" />

As can be seen, this is a helpful class to store fields that need to be edited.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Delete Module Command

#### Overview

The `delete` command is used to delete a module from the module plan. The module can only be deleted if it is already present in one of the semesters in the module plan.<br>

The format of the `delete` command can be found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-0.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#deleting-a-module-delete).<br>

#### Feature details

1. The user executes the `delete` command.
2. If the module code field is not provided, an error message with the correct command usage will be shown.
3. If invalid module code format is provided, an error message with the correct module code format will be shown.
4. If valid module code format is provided but `Module` does not exist in database, an error message informing user that the `Module` does not exist will be shown.
5. The `Module` is then cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if a module with the same `ModuleCode` exists in the module plan.
6. If the module does not exist in the module plan, an error message informing the user that the `Module` has not added to the module plan will be shown.
7. If all previous steps are completed without exceptions, the new `Module` will be successfully deleted from the module plan.

<br>

The following activity diagram shows the logic of deleting a `Module` from the module plan:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.puml" width="600" />

<br>

The sequence of the `delete` command is as follows:<br>

1. The user inputs the `delete` command.<br>
e.g. `delete CS3230`
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `ModulePlanParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `ModulePlanParser` then creates a new `DeleteCommandParser` to parse the fields provided by the user and a new `DeleteCommand` is created.
4. The `DeleteCommand` checks if the `ModuleCode` is valid by calling `Model#checkDbValidModuleCode`.
4. The `DeleteCommand` then checks if the `Model` contains a module with the same `ModuleCode` by calling `Model#getModule`.
5. If the `ModuleCode` is valid and `Model` contains the module, the `DeleteCommand` calls `Model#deleteModule` to delete the module from to the module plan.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delete` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" />

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Info Module Command

#### Overview

The `info` command is used to display information about a selected module, which is specified by the user by its module code.

The format of the `info` command can be found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-0.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#finding-information-about-a-module-info).

#### Feature details

1. The user enters the `info` command.
2. The `InfoCommandParser` checks that only a single argument is provided, and that the argument follows the valid module code format.
3. A `ParseException` is thrown if either of the above checks fail. Otherwise, an `InfoCommand` object will be created and executed.
4. The `InfoCommand` verifies that the module code exists in `ModuleData`. Otherwise, `ModuleNotFoundException` will be thrown.
5. The `Module` is retrieved from the database and the information is displayed to the user.

This is shown through the following activity diagram:

### Calculate CAP Command

#### Overview

The `calculateCAP` command is used to calculate the Cumulative Average Point (CAP) of all valid modules in the module plan, using their grade points and modular credits. <br>

The format of the `calculateCAP` command can be found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-0.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#calculating-the-total-current-cap-calculatecap).<br>

#### Feature details

1. The user executes the `calculateCAP` command.
2. If the previous step is completed without exceptions, the CAP will be calculated and displayed.

<br>

The sequence of the `calculateCAP` command is as follows:<br>

1. The user inputs the `calculateCAP` command.<br>
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `ModulePlanParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `ModulePlanParser` then creates a new `CalculateCapCommand`.
4. The `CalculateCapCommand` calculates the CAP by calling `Model#getCap`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `calculateCAP` command works:

### Calculate MC Command

#### Overview

The `calculateMC` command is used to calculate the total sum of Modular Credits (MCs) of all modules in the module plan, regardless of their grades. <br>

The format of the `calculateMC` command can be found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-0.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#calculating-the-total-current-modular-credits-mcs-calculatemc).<br>

#### Feature details

1. The user executes the `calculateMC` command.
2. If the previous step is completed without exceptions, the number of MCs will be calculated and displayed.

<br>

The sequence of the `calculateMC` command is as follows:<br>

1. The user inputs the `calculateMC` command.<br>
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `ModulePlanParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `ModulePlanParser` then creates a new `CalculateMcCommand`.
4. The `CalculateMcCommand` calculates the CAP by calling `Model#totalModularCredits`.

### \[Proposed\] Pre-requisite checking feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed pre-requisite checking mechanism is facilitated by `Prerequisite`. Every `Module` will have a `Prerequisite` field. `Prerequisite` contains a list of other `Prerequisite` objects, of which `Module` is a subclass. It also contains a number that represents the number of `Prerequisite`s in the list that need to be fulfilled before this `Prerequisite` can be considered fulfilled. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `Prerequisite#isFulfilled(List<Module> list)`: Checks whether the current `Prerequisite` is fulfilled by the `Module`s in `list`.

This operation is accessed in `Module` as `Module#checkPrerequisitesFulfilled(List<Module> list)`.

Here is the class diagram:

<puml src="diagrams/PrerequisiteClassDiagram.puml" />

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the prerequisite mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `add CS2103T y/2 s/1 g/IP` command to add the module `CS2103T` in the module plan. 

Step 2. When executing the `add` command, `Module#checkPrerequisitesFulfilled(List<Module> list)` is called to check if the prerequisites have been fulfilled in previous semesters. In this case, these are the Advanced Placement and Year 1 semesters, and the `Module`s in these semesters populate `list`.

Step 3. ModCraft lets the user know if the prerequisites have not been fulfilled, and which prerequisites. Otherwise, it adds the module `CS2103T` to Year 2 Semester 1.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the module is in the Advanced Placement, there are no other semesters to check.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides to move the module to an earlier semester, and decides to make the appropriate changes by executing the command `edit CS2103T y/1 s/2`. The `edit` command calls `Module#checkPrerequisitesFulfilled(List<Module> list)` again to check if the prerequisites have been fulfilled in previous semesters. In this case, they are the Advanced Placement and Year 1 Semester 1 semesters, and the `Module`s in these semesters populate `list`. 

Step 5. ModCraft lets the user know if the prerequisites have not been fulfilled, and which prerequisites. Otherwise, it moves the module `CS2103T` to Year 1 Semester 2.


The following sequence diagram shows how the prerequisite checking works:

## **Future enhancements**

For our next steps, we plan to add the following features:
* Check if a module is CS/CU or not, and check if the grade given from user input is valid for that module.
* Check which semesters a module is offered, and check if the semester given from user input is valid for that module.
* Check for a module's pre-requisites, and check if they are fulfilled before allowing the user to add the module.
* Check for a module's pre-clusions, and prevent users from adding modules that are pre-clusions of each other.
* Check for a module's co-requisites, and remind users to add modules that are co-requisites of each other and to take them concurrently.
* Check for a module's availability of S/U options, and prevent users from inputting S/U grades to non-S/U-able modules.
* Add support for allowing users to add a module that was failed in a previous semester to another new semester.
